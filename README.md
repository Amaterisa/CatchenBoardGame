# Catchen Boardgame
A drinking game with my pets as part of the board.

Implemented using Unity and C#. It's a turn based game where the player throws a dice and it's character moves the amount received. Fun to play with friends.

The board is generated with a script using cells size. Board pieces are generated with textures from resources folder, that are used to create Scriptable Objects by clicking on a Menu Item button. 

All images are from my pets and the song and sound effects were recorded with my bass.

I hope you enjoy!
